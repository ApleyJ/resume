      I am 26 years old trying to make his dream come true of becoming a
      freelance Full Stack Web Deveolper. I have always wanted to become a
      programmer in some capacity. When I started looking around at the
      different paths I could go, Wed Developement really interseted me. As for
      the freelance part of that I just got tired of working for other perople
      on their instead working on my time. So I decided why not try to work for
      yourself doing something you enjoy, well that thought has taken here on a
      journey to achive that goal.
